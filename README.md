# README

This repository will contain all of my course work for the Data Science Specialization capstone course offered
on Coursera from Johns Hopkins University.  The goal of these projects is to inject large amounts of text
data to perform analyses and predictive analytics using Natural Language Processing (NLP.)  Swiftkey
uses these techniques to predict which words you will use next based on your usage history.
